###### Design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably. Write up a description of your algorithm. 
###### Make sure this description states how it should improve equity and also how it might affect other concerns.
###### NO CODE IS NEEDED OR EXPECTED HERE -- just a description -- 


**Based on my research and Literature reading,** I think one way to design an algorithm that would seat people more equitably would be to **take into consideration past customer feedback and satisfaction ratings.** Based on this data the algorithm would look for satisfaction and unsatisfaction patterns in this data and adjust customer seating and accomodations based on the ratings. This was an idea suggested in the Literature I read.  

**Another option,** would be to **load passengers in a dynamic way where the algorithm adjusts in real time to various data sets at the time of each flight and before the passengers board.** Delta airlines began using this type of algorithm at the beginning of the Pandemic to ensure families can sit together.  According to the article, “The algorithm, which was first implemented right before the pandemic, uses ‘historical booking and seat assignment data’” Both aforementioned examples would address equity because it would account for customer dissatisfaction and customer feedback and adjust based on that data as well as dynamically adjusting so groups and families could sit together and adjusting based on the past historical data.  

**Lastly,** the framework for **my plane seating algorithm would be guided by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bill of Rights for Passengers released in July 2022.** The document includes some of the issues I have already addressed, such as customer dissatisfaction and feedback and seating groups and families together as well as addressing the needs of passengers with disabilities by seating them with accommodations and providing airline information in an accessible format.

While the customer feedback data adjusts retroactively and would work to improve the seating on the next upcoming flights, Delta’s dynamic algorithm would address the needs in real time and on the spot as well as implementing the Bil of Rights for Passengers.
